A simple e-commerce website Given the increasing demand for e-commerce, the user-friendly shopping experience is essential. 
The aim of this project is to develop a commercial experience for artists who want to present their works and make it easy for their customers to buy.

Django is a full-stack framework that brings back-end and front-end together in a seamless fashion. I will utilize inbuilt systems like: Django ; -auth for authentication and security, -models to set up a database, -render an API endpoint of some of the paintings for viewing.

As a user, you are in a position to do the following :

user can scroll through paintings displayed at the shop =>reroute to the homepage after a successful login
user will be in a position to sign up, sign in and logout user will be in a position to view cart and add order items user will be in a position to checkout

I will not store user data on any purchase. :)
